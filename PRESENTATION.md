## Presentation Notes 

### ABOUT ME
Hello everyone, my name is Kathleen! 
    My passion for Software Engineering started when I built an e-commerce website for my business. I really enjoy developing projects through code and previously worked freelance as a web developer and full stack web development bootcamp grad. 
    software developer | entrepreneur  

### APP BACKGROUND
Today I'd like to share my app, LULUSPAWS Community. 

An app to allow users to connect & create a Community with Pet Lovers (Dogs & Cats) through personal profile, posts, search bar, map 


##  REVIEW: TECH STACK & FEATURES

- SwiftUI

I wanted to take the challenge of learning databases with ios.

I decided on FireBase, because it allows real sync of data, quicker builds, thorough documentation, and made the Authentication process easier. 

### Firebase Database
- üé•: Signup - when user signs up 
    - Users will be able to signup, signin and post and this is created, read, and saved through the Firebase Storage & Database using MVVM.
    - I created two view model files to handle Users & Users Post
        - 1. StorageService - to save & access firestore database 
        - 2. AuthViewModel - to create/sign in users to database and save it to Firestorage 
    
#### User Authentication
        - Set up the storageViewModel 
            - in this saveUserProfileInfo function, we allow users to be able to save username, email, and imageData to access to their Profile 
        - then we went to AuthViewModel
                - to make a function to create    
                 Auth.auth().createUser
                     & save user info We also refer to saveUserProfileInfo function from StorageViewModel 
            
            - 2. SignInViewModel
            - üé•: SignIn 
                - In order to have the user saved to the DB, we needs to create a name for: collection & document
                - I named the collection: users & document after the userId that is autogenerated 
                          -   Firestore.firestore().collection("users).document(userId)
                - User will then be able to sign in if the userId is equal to userId trying to login  Auth.auth().signIn() 
               
### User Profile 
- üé•: Show the profile, then cut to the new profile with user info
- From there a user will be able to have a profile 
    -  I made a ProfileViewModel 
        - 1. save/edit profile function
            -  they will be able to edit their info based from User model
        - 2. show posts of user
            - Some challenges I faced with user profile:  
                - I took on challenge to read through learn and implement SDWebImageSwiftUI - SwiftUI Image Loading Framework to load photos 
                
                - Figuring out how to tie the users profile to the respective users post was tricky:
                    - fetchAllPosts of user and being able to make sure to access the right collection, document, and userId 


### User Posts
- üé•: Add a post and show on profile 
- Representing relationship between Users, Post, and Profile was a challenge, but I solved it by:
    - making a PostViewModel 
    - creating a function UploadPost 
        - we check to make sure userId is current user
        - then we follow the steps to:
            - add to Firebase.firestorage() db 
            - 1. add to posts collection 
            - 2. documentId 
            - 3. saves to our firebase storage
- Then it should appear on our profile, because I added a loadUserPosts function onAppear to show users post 

### Search Users  
- üé•: Search 
- Users will be able to search via username 
- I made a function searchUser to search users collection in firebase and add whereField("username") is equal to users input in search bar 

### FEATURES
- SwiftUI
- Firebase Database
- User Authentication
- Create User Profile
- SDWebImageSwiftUI 
- Post Photos 
- Search Users  
- MapKit
