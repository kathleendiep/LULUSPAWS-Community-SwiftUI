## Presentation Notes 

### ABOUT ME
Hello everyone, my name is Kathleen.
Previously, I was a Project Accountant and started my own business for dog products. My passion for Software Engineering started when I wanted to build an e-commerce website for my business. I really enjoyed welding projects into existence through code and making full stack websites.

### APP BACKGROUND
For my app, I wanted to make an app for pet lovers. Pets have statistically brought joy to many. And especially during the Pandemic, many have added a furry friend to their lives, including myself.
People AND pets thrive on connection, and what better way than to have technology help connect local pet lovers to share this common joy.

### CHALLENGES
I wanted to take the challenge of learning databases with ios. I decided on FireBase, because it allows real sync of data, quicker builds, thorough documentaiton, and made the Authentication process easier.
    
It took a bit to learn the documentation, and implement and learn to fetch all users depending on the document and collection. 


#### Overall, I hope you enjoyed myh project. Thank you for viewing my project.
